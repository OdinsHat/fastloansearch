================

This site was built mainly as an exercise to boost my experience
with the [Flask web framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and a
number of other technologies which I don't get to show
publically in my day job due to commercial reasons.

## Technology Used - Server side

* **[Python](http://www.python.org)** - Maybe a little obvious but all of the site components are founded on Python technologies (except nginx).
* **[Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/)** - Open source web framework for scraping the web. Used for spidering some results to add value to the user experience.
* **[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)** - for the main web request handling & serving
    * **[Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/)** - template system
* **[uWSGI](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org)** - the Python application server that sits behind...
* **[nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main)** - A webserver akin to Apache but one that I use to run all my websites both personal and work.
* **[SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)** - a Python database mega toolkit and ORM.
* **[Requests library](docs.python-requests.org)** - for accessing [Google CSE API via REST](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview)
* **[GruntJs](http://gruntjs.com/)** - Used for linting JS, minifying JS AND CCS and optimising images.
* **[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)** - purely for package management of GruntJS


## Technology Used - Client side

* **Bootstrap** - CSS framework.
* **CSS3 transitions** - both personally made and using Animate.css
* **JQuery** - for some animations.

## To Come
There is plenty more to come but I'd rather not put all my ideas down just yet.
